# ðŸ§  C++ Course Practice

This repository contains my C++ practice problems organized by topic and difficulty.  
Each folder contains one `.cpp` file with a solved exercise â€” because chaos belongs in runtime, not in file structure ðŸ˜„.

Here youâ€™ll find loops that never end, arrays that reverse themselves out of spite, and functions that sometimes do what I expect.  
Itâ€™s all part of the journey ðŸš€

Happy compiling... and may your bugs be shallow.
